This example shows how to create REST API with dotnet core and postgreSQL on MAC OS X
Discovered topics:
1. EF works with PostgreeSQL
2. Migrations
3. Versioning
4. REST API
5. I’ve got plans for the next bunch of things:
	- Add Unit of Work pattern and create more layers (projects)
	- Add OAUTH 2.0



Requirements:
- OSX (could be linux or windows, it’s really doesn’t matter. If so just start with .Net core and PostgreeSQL on choosen platform)

- homebrew and PostgreSQL
