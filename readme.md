### Using VS Code on my MAC
I begin this repo with idea to test building some .Net Core apps on MAC OS X without Visual Studio on Parallel desktop.

So I think a little bit and started with designing REST API with following features: 
1. PostgreeSQL 
2. ASP.NET CORE API with versioining
3. EF with migrations
4. ASP.NET CORE MVC with Tag helpers and attribute validation for View Model

#### Discovered topcis in coreapiwithpostgresql app
* Net Core with EF Core
* Postgree SQL with EF Core and migrations
* REST API with Versioning with header

#### Layered App architectural template for layered app
* Unit of Work pattern 
* Layered app - Controller without any logic
* ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers

#### Discovered topics in LoggingSample
* Logging infrastructure in NetCore, providers, levels, filters and so on

#### Discovered topics in OAuthCore
* OAUTH 2.0 in NetCore
* ASP.NET Identity Framework Migration From .Net Framework 4.5 to ASP.Net Core 2.0

#### Exploring MailKit API in MailKitTest
* main goal - to understand diffrences between .Net framework SMTP client and realization in MailKit

#### Exploring Automapper in AutomapperTest
* main goal - feel the benefits in real world of layered app

#### Requirements:
* OSX (could be linux or windows, it’s really doesn’t matter. If so just start with .Net core and PostgreeSQL on choosen platform)

* [homebrew and PostgreSQL](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/)

* [install node with homebrew](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x)
